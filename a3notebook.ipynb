    "All cells that read `YOUR ANSWER HERE` are free-response cells that are editable and are to be completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use any number of notebook cells to explore the data and test out your functions, although you will only be graded on the solution itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You are unable to modify the read-only cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also use Markdown cells to explain your code and discuss your results when necessary.\n",

    "All floating point values should be printed with **2 decimal places** precision. You can do so using the built-in round function.\n",

    "**Grading**\n",

    "For code-completion questions you will be graded on passing the public test cases we have included, as well as any hidden test cases that we have supplemented to ensure that your logic is correct.\n",

    " - *\"I'm going to Maryland, did I tell you?\"*\n",

    "\n",
    "What makes this difficult is that journalists often modify the quotes, so exact matching will not always work."
