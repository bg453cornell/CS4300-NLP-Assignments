    "## Priming. How much is a character's word choice influenced by the person they are speaking to?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Priming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology) is the phenomenon where a speaker tends to repeat certain words or language characteristics of the person they are replying to. It turns out that priming can often be observed in conversation. If A is talking to B, B will sometimes tend to use mirror A's language. We define a simple approximation of this, probabilistically, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1 (Code Completion): Character Priming\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis we will be looking at priming: i.e. when speaker A replies to speaker B, what is the probability that a word said by B will be repeated by A? \n",
    "\n",
    "That is, how many of the words in A's reply were also said by B (normalized by the number of words A said in total)?\n",
    "Specifically, consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Cristian: Hi Ilan, it is a really nice day today. Yes, it is.\n",
    "Ilan: It is a really really nice day today! Yes.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We should take the set of all words said by Cristian here (hi, ilan, it, is, a, really, nice, day, today, yes) $W_c$ and the set of all words said by Ilan here (it is a really nice day today yes) $W_i$, and compute $\\frac{|W_c \\cap W_i|}{|W_i|}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a specific *ordered* pair of speakers A and B, we then calculate the *arithmetic mean* among all pairs of adjacent utterences by them to get a single number between 0 and 1 as the answer to this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next couple methods will walk you through necessary pre-computations to get this priming matrix.\n",
    "Do read through these functions carefully as you will be using their results."
